The example is a single circle dectection implementation with our proposed IRCD algorithm. There are three files of source codes including cdMethodZXE.cpp, cdMethodZXE.h and mainTestIRCD.cpp, where the mainTestIRCD.cpp is the main file of these codes which are implemented with C++ on the platform Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, and the operating system is Windows 10 (64bit). Note that OpenCV tool (https://opencv.org/) is needed. Please create a new Visual Studio project and add cdMethodZXE.cpp and cdMethodZXE.h into the project. 

if you have any questions about the proposed algorithm IRCD, please contact the email: zhouxianen@hnu.edu.cn.
