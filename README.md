The example is a single circle dectection implementation with our proposed IRCD algorithm. There are three files including cdMethodZXE.cpp, cdMethodZXE.h and mainTestIRCD.cpp, where the mainTestIRCD.cpp is the main file of these codes which are implemented with C++ on the platform Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, and the operating system is Windows 10 (64bit). Note that OpenCV tool (https://opencv.org/) is needed.
